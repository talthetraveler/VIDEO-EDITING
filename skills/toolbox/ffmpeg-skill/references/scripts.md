# Script reference

Every script prints the same information with `--help`; this file exists so the agent can read several at once. All scripts accept `--dry-run`, `--json`, `--fast`, `--progress`, `--timeout SECONDS`, `--overwrite`, `-o OUT` -- but `--dry-run` only guarantees nothing is written for writing tools: `probe` (read-only, `--dry-run` changes nothing) still runs ffprobe, `check`/`sync`/`multicam`/`scenes`/`cropdetect`/`report`/`silence`/`loudness`/`stabilize` still run their ffmpeg/ffprobe measurements (a dry-run plan rests on real numbers; they just don't write the final artifact), and `verify` accepts the flag but ignores it entirely. Exact per-tool semantics: `contract --json`'s `dry_run` field (or `docs/contract.md`).

## Scripts

### probe.py — inspect
```
probe.py INPUT... [--compact] [--field duration|video.fps|...]
```
JSON with `duration`, `video{codec,width,height,fps,pix_fmt,color_space,rotation,variable_frame_rate_suspected}`,
`audio{codec,channels,sample_rate}`. `--compact` gives one line per file.

### cut.py — cut / join segments
```
cut.py INPUT [--start T] [--end T | --duration T] [--segments A-B,C-D,...] [--accurate] [-o OUT]
```
Times accept `12.5`, `1:30`, `00:01:30.250`. Default is `-c copy` (snaps to
keyframes, instant, lossless); if the snapped result deviates more than
`--tolerance` (0.5 s) from the request, that segment is re-encoded automatically
(x264 CRF 18). `--accurate` always re-encodes; `--tolerance -1` never does.
Multiple segments are concatenated in the order given. stderr reports whether
the result was "lossless stream copy" or "re-encoded".

### fit.py — target duration and/or aspect, rotate/flip
```
fit.py INPUT [--duration T --method speed|trim [--from-center] [--max-speed 4]]
             [--aspect 16:9|9:16|1:1|4:5|W:H --fit pad|crop [--width W] [--height H] [--pad-color black] [--pad-fill color|blur [--pad-blur 20]]]
             [--rotate 90|180|270] [--flip h|v] [--fps N] [-o OUT]
```
`speed` retimes video and audio together (pitch-preserving `atempo`); it
refuses factors beyond `--max-speed`. For slow motion add `--smooth blend`
(frame blending, fast) or `--smooth interpolate` (motion-compensated
`minterpolate`, fluid but roughly 10-20x slower than realtime). `trim` keeps
the head (or the middle with `--from-center`). `--width`/`--height` set the
output size: give one and the other follows the aspect (source aspect if
`--aspect` isn't also given); give both for an exact frame. `--rotate` applies
a new clockwise rotation (90/180/270 swap width/height for 90 and 270 — this
is separate from the rotation *metadata* fit.py already reads to size a
source correctly); `--flip h|v` mirrors the picture; both can combine, rotate
first. `--fps` forces a constant frame rate; VFR sources are conformed
automatically even without it.
`--pad-fill blur` fills the letterbox/pillarbox bars with a blurred, scaled-to-cover copy
of the frame (the look every phone editor gives landscape footage posted as a Short/Reel)
instead of the solid `--pad-color`; `--pad-blur` is the blur radius. `export.py --fit pad`
takes the same two flags.

### crop.py — crop to an exact pixel rectangle
```
crop.py INPUT --x X --y Y --width W --height H [-o OUT]
```
Crops to a literal `{x, y, width, height}` rectangle in source pixels —
distinct from `fit.py --fit crop`, which crops to an *aspect ratio* and picks
the rectangle for you. Use this when the rectangle is already known (a
face-detection box, a saved crop, a hand-picked region). The rectangle must
lie entirely inside the source frame (after accounting for display rotation);
`--width`/`--height` must be even (4:2:0 chroma) and are refused, never
rounded, if they aren't.

### cropdetect.py — measure black bars, report the crop rectangle
```
cropdetect.py INPUT [--seconds N] [--samples N] [--limit F] [--round N]
```
Measurement only -- writes no file. Samples `--samples` windows spread
across the file (default 5, totalling `--seconds` 10s of footage) and
reports the crop rectangle FFmpeg's `cropdetect` filter found most often, as
`{x, y, width, height}` ready to hand to `crop.py`. Distinct from
`fit.py --fit crop`, which crops to a target aspect ratio it computes
itself with no black-bar measurement involved. A rectangle that matches the
full source frame means no bars were found. Does not decide whether
removing detected bars is wanted -- genuine letterboxed content (a
scope-ratio film in a 16:9 frame) "detects" the same way as accidental
bars; look at the frame before cropping it away.

### deinterlace.py — deinterlace interlaced footage
```
deinterlace.py INPUT [--mode frame|field] [--parity auto|tff|bff] [--only-interlaced] [-o OUT]
```
Wraps FFmpeg's `yadif` filter. `--mode frame` (default) keeps the source
frame rate; `--mode field` emits one frame per field, doubling the output
frame rate. `--parity` overrides field order when the container gets it
wrong; `--only-interlaced` skips frames the source doesn't itself mark
interlaced. Does not detect whether the source needs deinterlacing --
that's a `look.py` judgement call (visible combing on motion).

### denoise.py — reduce video noise/grain
```
denoise.py INPUT [--strength low|medium|high] [--luma-spatial F] [--chroma-spatial F]
                  [--luma-temporal F] [--chroma-temporal F] [-o OUT]
```
Wraps FFmpeg's `hqdn3d` filter. `--strength` picks a tested preset scaling
all four of hqdn3d's spatial/temporal luma/chroma parameters together; the
four `--luma-*`/`--chroma-*` flags override any of them individually.
Heavier denoising trades fine detail for a cleaner but softer image -- for
audio noise reduction use `audio.py --denoise` instead, this tool only
touches the picture.

### redact.py — blur or pixelate an exact rectangle
```
redact.py INPUT --x X --y Y --width W --height H [--mode blur|pixelate]
                 [--blur-strength N] [--block-size N] [-o OUT]
```
Same rectangle convention as `crop.py` -- the rectangle must already be
known (a saved detection box, a hand-picked region); this tool does not
locate faces or plates itself. `--mode blur` (default) box-blurs the
rectangle; `--mode pixelate` mosaics it into `--block-size`-px blocks, the
more unmistakably-redacted look often wanted for compliance footage. The
rest of the frame, and the whole clip's timeline, are untouched -- to
redact only part of the timeline, `cut.py` the clip into segments first.

### sphere.py — flat viewport extraction from 360/spherical video
```
sphere.py INPUT [--input-projection equirect|fisheye|dfisheye|c3x2|c6x1|barrel|cylindrical|hequirect]
                 [--yaw D] [--pitch D] [--roll D] [--h-fov D] [--v-fov D]
                 [--width W] [--height H] [--interp METHOD] [--stereo mono|sbs|tb]
                 [--audio-stream N] [-o OUT]
```
Wraps FFmpeg's `v360` filter to bake out an ordinary flat clip pointed at a
fixed direction — the same "look this way" operation a VR headset or a 360
player's viewport does. `--yaw`/`--pitch`/`--roll` aim the camera (each
-180..180, default 0); `--h-fov`/`--v-fov` set how wide the view is (each
1..170, default 90/60). `--input-projection` must match the source's own
projection (default `equirect`, the most common capture/export format) —
this tool cannot detect it from the pixels, so a wrong value produces a
distorted or garbled output, not an error. There is no subject detection or
tracking here: only the typed aim you give it. For a shot that follows a
moving subject, call this once per keyframe viewpoint from outside this
tool. `--width`/`--height` must be even (4:2:0 chroma); default 1920x1080.

### straighten.py — rotate by an arbitrary angle (horizon correction)
```
straighten.py INPUT --degrees D [--fit crop|pad] [--fill-color C] [-o OUT]
```
Distinct from `fit.py --rotate`, which only turns the picture in exact
90-degree steps -- this wraps FFmpeg's `rotate` filter for a small
corrective tilt (`--degrees`, -45..45). Rotating by a non-90-degree angle
leaves triangular gaps at the corners: `--fit crop` (default) scales up
just enough to fill the frame with no visible gap, losing a thin border of
the original picture; `--fit pad` keeps the full original picture and fills
the gaps with `--fill-color`. Does not measure the tilt itself -- give the
degrees once you can see how far off it is (a `look.py` judgement call).

### insert.py — still image to a timed silent clip
```
insert.py IMAGE --duration T [--width W] [--height H] [--fps N]
                 [--zoom in|out [--zoom-amount 1.3]] [--pan left|right|up|down] [-o OUT]
```
Produces a silent, exact-duration clip from one image. `--width`/`--height`
resolve like `fit.py`'s (one given -> the other follows the image's aspect;
both given -> exact frame, scaled to fill and centre-cropped, never
distorted). `--zoom in|out` is a Ken Burns effect: a slow linear zoom across
the whole clip, ending (zoom in) or starting (zoom out) at `--zoom-amount`
(default 1.3). `--pan` drifts the visible window across the image while
zoomed — it needs `--zoom` (panning uses the extra image area a zoom exposes).

### background.py — generate a solid-colour or gradient clip
```
background.py -o OUT --duration T --width W --height H
              [--color C | --gradient C1:C2 [--angle DEG]]
```
No input file: ffmpeg's own `color`/`gradients` source filters generate the
clip directly. For a title-card background, a placeholder layer, or a base
for `overlay.py` to composite onto. `--width`/`--height` must be even.

### reverse.py — reverse playback
```
reverse.py INPUT [--no-audio] [-o OUT]
```
Reverses video (and audio, unless `--no-audio`) with ffmpeg's `reverse`/
`areverse` filters, which buffer the whole clip in memory — keep this to
clips it makes sense to reverse (seconds to a couple of minutes), not
something this tool limits for you.

### stabilize.py — motion stabilisation
```
stabilize.py INPUT [--shakiness 1-10] [--smoothing N] [--zoom 0-100] [-o OUT]
```
Two-pass `vidstabdetect`/`vidstabtransform`: pass 1 analyses camera motion to
a temporary transforms file (deleted after the run), pass 2 smooths and
re-renders. `--shakiness` (default 5) trades analysis time for how much
motion it looks for; `--smoothing` (default 15) is how many neighbouring
frames the camera path is averaged over; `--zoom` crops in slightly to hide
the black edges stabilizing can introduce. Needs an ffmpeg built with
`--enable-libvidstab`; `doctor` reports this tool `usable: no` when that's
missing (a plain Homebrew ffmpeg build, for example) rather than failing at
run time.

### sequence.py — numbered/globbed image sequence to video
```
sequence.py --dir DIR --pattern "frame_%04d.png"|"*.png" --fps N
            [--start-number N] [--width W] [--height H] [-o OUT]
```
Turns a numbered or glob-matched set of still images into a video. Glob
matches are ordered naturally (`img2` before `img10`). The match
is checked on disk before ffmpeg runs (an empty match or a missing first
frame is refused here, not discovered from an opaque ffmpeg error).

### waveform.py — audio waveform/spectrum visualization video
```
waveform.py INPUT [--style waveform|spectrum] [--width W] [--height H] [--fps N]
                   [--color C] [--background C] [--waveform-mode M] [--split-channels] [-o OUT]
```
Renders the input's audio as a video: `--style waveform` (default, FFmpeg's
`showwaves`) draws amplitude over time; `--style spectrum` (`showspectrum`)
draws a frequency-over-time heatmap instead, reading more out of dense
mixes at the cost of being less immediately readable. The output always
carries the audio it visualizes. For an audio-only input (no video stream
needed) or any file with an audio track worth visualizing.

### freeze.py — hold a frame for N seconds
```
freeze.py INPUT --hold T [--at T] [--mode insert|extend] [-o OUT]
```
`--at` (default: the last frame) is the timestamp to freeze; `--hold` is
how long the freeze lasts. `--mode insert` (default) inserts the hold at
`--at`, pushing everything after it later by `--hold` seconds. `--mode
extend` only works with `--at` at (or past) the clip's end and just makes
the last frame last `--hold` seconds longer, with nothing pushed. Audio is
silent during the held frame in `--mode insert` (there is no source audio
for a frozen moment that didn't exist before). `--mode insert` drops a
subtitle/data track rather than copy it with timestamps that no longer match
the pushed picture (`dropped_non_av_streams: true` in the result), as
`fit.py --method speed` does; `--mode extend` keeps it.

### pad.py — add black/silent padding at the start/end
```
pad.py INPUT [--start T] [--end T] [--color C] [-o OUT]
```
Distinct from `fit.py --fit pad`, which pads the *frame* (letterbox/
pillarbox bars around each existing frame) -- this pads the *timeline*:
extra seconds of solid colour and silence before and/or after the clip's
existing content (seconds or `mm:ss`). At least one of `--start`/`--end` must be > 0.

### speedramp.py — step through different speeds across a clip
```
speedramp.py INPUT --segment START-END:FACTOR [--segment ...] [-o OUT]
```
Distinct from `fit.py --duration --method speed`, which applies one
constant factor to the whole clip -- this takes a list of `--segment`
pieces (repeatable) covering the clip start to end with no gaps or
overlaps, each played at its own constant speed (pitch-preserving audio,
matching `fit.py`), then concatenates them: "speed up, then slow way down
for the punch, then speed back up," built from a few constant segments
rather than a continuous curve. `START`/`END` take seconds or `mm:ss`;
`FACTOR` is 0.05..20 (2.0 = twice as fast,
0.5 = half speed). Picking exactly where a ramp should ease in or out is a
judgement call for the calling agent, made concrete here as the segment
boundaries it supplies.

### loop.py — repeat a clip
```
loop.py INPUT --times N | --duration T [-o OUT]
```
`--times` repeats the whole clip that many times back to back (2 =
original + 1 repeat). `--duration` instead loops (and trims the last
repeat) to hit an exact target length. For a background loop, an ambient
bed, or filling a fixed slot length with a short clip. Does not smooth the
loop point (no crossfade at the seam) -- a clip that doesn't already loop
cleanly will show a visible cut/pop at each repeat, which is a property of
the source material this tool cannot fix.

### broll.py — cut away to a B-roll clip and come back
```
broll.py A.mp4 --insert B.mp4 --at T [--duration D | --end T2] [--from T3]
               [--insert ... --at ...] [--audio a|b|mix] [--pad-color black] [-o OUT]
```
A plays as it is; during each window B's picture is shown instead (scaled and
padded to A's frame, A's fps), and A resumes at its own time when the window
ends -- a cutaway, not a splice, so the output is exactly as long as A. One
`--insert`/`--at` pair per cutaway (`--duration`, `--end`, `--from` are per
cutaway too, or given once for all; defaults 4 s and 0); windows may not
overlap or run past A's end, and B must have enough material from `--from`.
`--audio a` (default) keeps A's audio untouched and stream-copied; `b` replaces
it inside each window with B's; `mix` plays both. The output's length is
verified against A's.

### metadata.py — chapter markers and container tags, streams copied
```
metadata.py INPUT [--chapters chapters.txt | --clear-chapters]
                  [--title T] [--artist A] [--album A] [--comment C] [--date D] [--genre G] [-o OUT]
```
`chapters.txt` holds one chapter per line, `TIME TITLE` (cut.py's time syntax:
seconds, mm:ss, hh:mm:ss.ms); each chapter ends where the next starts and the
last runs to the end of the file. Starts must ascend and lie inside the file.
Every stream is `-c copy` (bit for bit; `probe` reports the result under
`chapters` and `tags`), so this is instant and lossless. Chapter markers need a
container that can hold them (.mp4/.m4v/.m4a/.mov, .mkv/.mka/.webm); `.wav`,
`.gif`, `.mp3` and `.flac` outputs are refused for `--chapters` rather than
silently dropping them. Tags alone are written to any container that has them.
`--clear-chapters` removes existing markers; an empty tag value (`--comment ""`)
clears that tag.

### grid.py — composite clips into a grid
```
grid.py CLIP1 CLIP2 [...] --cols N --rows N [--cell-width W] [--cell-height H]
                          [--label auto|none] [--font NAME] [--audio-from I]
                          [--pad] [-o OUT]
```
Letterboxes every clip into a common `--cell-width`x`--cell-height` cell (no
stretching) and tiles them `--cols`x`--rows`, filled left-to-right,
top-to-bottom -- the input count must equal cols*rows exactly. `--label auto`
(default) burns each clip's filename (extension stripped) into its cell's
bottom-right corner; `--label none` skips it. No audio unless `--audio-from`
picks one input's track by index -- mixing every clip's audio together is
rarely useful for a comparison grid, so this tool never does that silently.
Runs only as long as the shortest clip by default; `--pad` instead holds
each shorter clip's last frame (with silence) out to the longest.

### silence.py — remove dead air / jump cuts
```
silence.py INPUT [--threshold -35] [--min-silence 0.6] [--margin 0.15] [--min-keep 0.2] [--list] [--edl keep.txt] [-o OUT]
```
Runs `silencedetect`, keeps `--margin` seconds of air around speech, drops
gaps shorter than `--min-silence`, and re-encodes once with `select`/`aselect`
(frame accurate). `--list` prints silences, kept ranges and seconds removed
without rendering; `--edl` saves the kept ranges in `cut.py --segments` format
so the user can edit the list by hand. Quiet rooms need `--threshold -40`
to `-45`; noisy ones `-30`. Always tell the user how many seconds were removed.

### join.py — concatenate with transitions
```
join.py CLIP1 CLIP2 [...] [--transition fade|dissolve|wipeleft|slideleft|fadeblack|fadewhite|circleopen|none]
        [--duration 0.5] [--width W --height H] [--fps N] [--fit pad|crop] [-o OUT]
```
Normalises every clip to one frame size, fps, `yuv420p`, 48 kHz and one
channel layout (the widest clip's -- a 5.1 clip keeps 5.1 -- or `--channels`;
silent track generated for clips without audio), then chains `xfade` +
`acrossfade`. Output length = sum of clips − transition × (n−1). Clips must be
longer than 2 × the transition. Use `--transition none` for a plain cut.

### render.py — the whole edit in one project.json
```
render.py --init project.json                # starter file
render.py project.json [--fast] [--dry-run] [--stop-after STAGE] [--work DIR --keep]
```
Stages: clips (cut, optional speed) → join (transition) → silence → fit →
captions → graphics → overlays → audio → loudness → export → check. Keys mirror the
CLI flags of each script (see the docstring). Use it whenever an edit has
more than two steps or the user is likely to ask for changes: edit the JSON,
re-render, and the result is reproducible. `--dry-run --json` prints the
complete command plan for review.

### scenes.py — scene changes and highlight candidates
```
scenes.py INPUT [--threshold 10] [--min-scene 1] [--highlights N [--target SECONDS] [--max-scene 15]] [--edl picks.txt] [--sheet scenes.png] [--json]
```
Lists scenes with audio energy, the loudest moments, and (with
`--highlights`) proposes N ranges that add up to `--target` seconds, biased to
the loudest window of each scene. Review the sheet + JSON, adjust the EDL, then
`cut.py --segments`. Cut detection is a one-frame spike test (benchmark on
hard cuts between real single takes: precision 0.95, recall 1.00 at the default
threshold; raise `--threshold` to 12 for 0.98 precision at 0.94 recall).
Dissolves and very slow fades are not cuts and will be missed. Highlights are
a proposal engine, not a judgement of content: tell the user what it picked
and why (energy, scene length).

### check.py — pre-delivery compliance
```
check.py INPUT --platform youtube|shorts|reels|tiktok|x|linkedin|broadcast|podcast|custom [--no-loudness] [--json]
         [--max-duration S] [--aspect 9:16] [--lufs -14] [--tp -1] [--max-mb N]
```
PASS/WARN/FAIL per check with the script that fixes it. Run it as the final
step before reporting a deliverable; fix FAILs, mention WARNs.

### batch.py — same recipe over a folder, cached
```
batch.py FOLDER --recipe batch.json [--force] [--watch SECONDS] [--json]
```
`batch.json` holds either `steps` (a list of script argv with `{in}`/`{out}`
placeholders, chained) or `project` (a render project applied per file).
Outputs land in `output_dir` with `suffix`; a content-hash cache skips files
already done with the same recipe. Use `--dry-run` to preview the plan.

### caption.py --transcribe — optional local speech-to-text
If `whisper-cli` (whisper.cpp), `faster-whisper` or `whisper` is installed,
`caption.py input.mp4 --transcribe [--language ja] [--model base]` writes the
SRT from the audio and burns it (combine with `--animate pop --karaoke`).
Nothing is downloaded and nothing is required: without an engine it prints
install hints and the user can supply `--text` cues instead. Always tell the
user which engine was used, and treat the transcript as a draft to review.

### MCP server — the toolkit for any MCP client
`python3 mcp/server.py` speaks MCP over stdio; each script is a tool taking
named args (flags without dashes, underscores for hyphens) or `argv`. Config
for Claude Desktop / Claude Code:
`{"mcpServers": {"ffmpeg-skill": {"command": "python3", "args": ["~/.claude/skills/ffmpeg-skill/mcp/server.py"]}}}`.
Inside this skill, call the scripts directly; the server is for other hosts.

### graphics.py — motion-graphics templates
```
graphics.py INPUT --template lower-third|title|chapter|progress|countdown|bug [--name] [--title] [--subtitle]
            [--from N] [--start S] [--end E] [--position CORNER] [--brand brand.json] [--primary RRGGBB] [--scale 1.0] [-o OUT]
```
Drawn with drawbox/drawtext/overlay — no PNG assets needed. Sizes scale with
the frame's short side; colours, font and safe margin come from `--brand`.
Lower-third slides in over 0.4 s and out over 0.3 s; title/chapter/bug fade.

### brand.json — one file for fonts, colours, logo, margins
```json
{"font": "Noto Sans CJK JP", "font_file": "fonts/NotoSansCJK-Bold.ttc",
 "colors": {"primary": "FF6A00", "text": "FFFFFF", "outline": "000000", "background": "0B1D2A"},
 "logo": "logo.png", "logo_position": "top-right", "logo_scale": 160, "logo_opacity": 0.9,
 "safe_margin": 48, "caption": {"size": 28, "position": "bottom", "animate": "pop", "karaoke": true, "bold": true}}
```
`caption.py --brand`, `overlay.py --brand --logo`, `graphics.py --brand`, and
`"brand": "brand.json"` in a render project. Explicit flags still win. When a
user mentions brand guidelines, colours, "our font" or a logo, ask for or
write a brand.json once and reuse it across every output.

### report.py — HTML delivery report
```
report.py --after FINAL [--before SOURCE] [--platform youtube] [--commands cmds.txt] [--notes notes.md] [--title T] [--no-sheets] [-o report.html]
```
One self-contained HTML: before/after facts and contact sheets, loudness,
compliance table with fixes, commands. Produce it for any multi-step job and
hand the path to the user together with the numbers.

### multicam.py — align several cameras and switch between them
```
multicam.py REF CAM2 [CAM3 ...] [--switch "START-END:CAM,..."] | [--auto N] [--audio IDX] [--fix-drift]
            [--offsets-only] [--width W --height H --fps N] [-o OUT]
```
All inputs are aligned to the first one by audio (same engine as `sync.py`,
`--fix-drift` for long takes). `--switch` names which camera is on screen for
each range of the reference timeline (gaps fall back to camera 0), `--auto N`
simply alternates every N seconds. Audio comes from the reference unless
`--audio` picks another input, e.g. an external recorder that has no video.
`--offsets-only` reports offsets and confidence without rendering.

### verify.py — real-footage verification kit
```
verify.py FILES_OR_FOLDERS [--quick] [--report verify.md] [--out DIR --keep] [--seconds 6] [--json]
```
Runs the toolchain on the user's own files (phone HDR, GoPro, OBS, Log, Zoom)
and prints a PASS/FAIL table per step (probe, copy cut, accurate cut, fit,
caption, overlay, look, export, loudness, silence, plus `color --to-sdr` for
HDR and `audio --downmix` for >2 channels). Exit code 1 if anything fails.
Run this first when a user hands over footage from a device you have not
seen before, and fix or report what fails.

### look.py — see the result
```
look.py INPUT [--tiles 4x3] [--width 1280] [-o sheet.png]         # contact sheet with timecodes
look.py INPUT --at 2.5 [--at 7] [-o basename]                     # single frames -> basename_2.500s.png
look.py BEFORE --compare AFTER --at 4 [-o cmp.png]                # side-by-side frame
```
Outputs PNG. View it with the Read tool (or any image viewer) and judge the
frame like an editor would. Use `--compare` to show before/after to the user.

### caption.py — subtitles (static, animated, karaoke)
```
caption.py INPUT --srt FILE | --ass FILE | --text CUES.txt [--write-srt OUT.srt]
           [--mode burn|mux] [--audio-stream N] [--fps N]
           [--font NAME] [--fonts-dir DIR] [--size N] [--color RRGGBB] [--outline N] [--outline-color RRGGBB]
           [--bold] [--box] [--position bottom|top|center|top-left|...] [--margin N]
           [--animate none|fade|pop|slide] [--karaoke [--highlight-color RRGGBB]] [--write-ass OUT.ass] [-o OUT]
caption.py --text CUES.txt --write-srt OUT.srt        # generate the SRT only
```
Text cue format, one per line: `0:00-0:03 Hello`, `00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06 Two | lines`,
or `00:00:03:15 --> 00:00:06:00 SMPTE non-drop-frame timecode` (`hh:mm:ss:ff`, frame count
converted with `--fps`, or the input video's own fps when `--input` is given and `--fps` is
not — a timecode-shaped cue with no fps available is refused rather than misread as plain text).
Lines without a time run for `--auto-seconds` (3 s) after the previous cue. `|` is a line break.
`--animate`/`--karaoke` generate a styled ASS (PlayRes = video size) from the
SRT/text cues: `pop` is the short-form "bouncy" entrance, `--karaoke` fills each
word from `--color` to `--highlight-color` evenly across the cue (word timing
is distributed, not transcribed). The ASS is kept next to the output so the
user can hand-tune timings and re-run with `--ass`.
`--mode burn` (default) renders subtitles into the picture and always
re-encodes both streams. `--mode mux` copies video and audio untouched and
adds the SRT as a separate, player-toggleable subtitle stream instead —
takes only a plain SRT (`--srt`/`--text`/`--transcribe`, not `--ass`, since
styling has no soft-subtitle equivalent) and no `--animate`/`--karaoke`. The
subtitle codec follows the output container: `mov_text` for `.mp4`/`.m4v`/`.mov`,
`srt` for `.mkv`, `webvtt` for `.webm`.
`--audio-stream N` (default 0, the first track) picks which audio stream of a
multi-track input (dubbed languages, M&E stems) is kept — applies to burn's
re-encoded audio, mux's stream-copied audio, `--transcribe`'s speech-to-text
source, and karaoke's energy-timing analysis alike, so all four agree on the
same track instead of each silently defaulting to whichever one ffmpeg's own
stream selection would have picked.

### overlay.py — logo, image, title, video picture-in-picture, chroma key
```
overlay.py INPUT --image PNG [--scale W | --scale-percent P] | --text "..." [--font-file F.ttf] [--font-size N] [--box]
                  | --video CLIP [--chromakey COLOR [--chromakey-similarity 0-1] [--chromakey-blend 0-1]]
           [--position top-right|bottom-left|center|X,Y] [--margin N] [--start T] [--end T] [--fade S] [--opacity 0-1] [-o OUT]
```
Alpha in PNGs is respected. Fades apply to the overlay only; the video keeps
playing. `--video` composites a second video as a picture-in-picture layer
(same position/scale/opacity/time-range knobs as `--image`); only the main
input's audio is kept, the PiP layer's own audio is dropped. `--chromakey`
(with `--video`) keys out that colour first for green-screen compositing.

### sync.py — offset detection, alignment, drift correction
```
sync.py REFERENCE SECOND [--json] [--max-offset 30] [--analyze-seconds 120] [--fix-drift [--drift-window 60]]
        [--replace-audio | --trim-second] [-o OUT]
```
Cross-correlates loudness envelopes: coarse FFT search (20 ms), then a direct
1 ms refinement (pure Python, a 2-minute window takes ~1-3 s). Positive offset
= the second recording started later. `--replace-audio` writes the reference
video with the second file's audio aligned (video stream copied); the output
keeps the reference's full length -- a shorter or head-trimmed second file is
padded with silence, never allowed to cut the picture.
`--trim-second` writes the second file shifted to the reference timeline.
`--fix-drift` measures the offset again near the end of the overlap, reports
the clock difference in ppm, and resamples the second file so a 60-minute
take stays in sync (typical consumer devices drift 20-500 ppm = up to 1.8 s/h).
Use it whenever the recording is longer than ~10 minutes. Check `confidence`
(0–1, normalised correlation with a runner-up penalty); below 0.3 the match is
doubtful. Benchmark on real dialogue/music (±30 s offsets, gain, noise, EQ):
with the default 120 s window 40/40 within 10 ms (max 1.1 ms); with a 60 s
window 95 %, misses flagged below 0.3. Keep `--analyze-seconds` at least 4×
`--max-offset` (default 120 s vs 30 s): lags with under 35 % overlap are
ignored, so an offset larger than ~60 % of the window cannot be found.

### color.py — HDR to SDR, LUTs, colour tags, Dolby Vision
```
color.py INPUT --to-sdr [--tonemap hable|mobius|reinhard|bt2390] [--peak 1000] [--desat 0] [-o OUT]
color.py INPUT --lut grade.cube [--lut-strength 0..1] [-o OUT]
color.py INPUT --retag bt709|bt2020-pq|bt2020-hlg|bt601 [-o OUT]      # metadata only, stream copy
color.py INPUT --strip-dovi [-o OUT]                                 # drop the Dolby Vision RPU, keep the HLG/HDR10 base layer (stream copy)
color.py INPUT --correct [--exposure -3..3] [--contrast 0..2] [--saturation 0..2] [--gamma 0.1..10]
         [--temperature 2000..12000] [--tint -1..1] [--lift -1..1] [--gain -1..1]
         [--levels-in-black 0..255] [--levels-in-white 0..255] [--levels-out-black 0..255] [--levels-out-white 0..255]
         [--curves color_negative|cross_process|darker|increase_contrast|lighter|linear_contrast|medium_contrast|negative|strong_contrast|vintage] [-o OUT]
```
`--correct` is typed primary colour correction, no filter string ever accepted:
`--exposure`/`--contrast`/`--saturation`/`--gamma` (`exposure`/`eq` filters),
`--temperature`/`--tint`/`--lift`/`--gain` (`colortemperature`/`colorbalance`
filters — `--tint` sets midtones, `--lift` shadows, `--gain` highlights, a
classic three-way correction), `--levels-*` (`colorlevels`, 8-bit units
converted to the filter's own 0..1 range, only added to the chain when at
least one is given) and `--curves` (the `curves` filter's own built-in
presets, only added when given). Every flag is range-checked against this
script's own safe subset of what `ffmpeg -h filter=<name>` documents before
ffmpeg runs. `--json`'s `measurements` reports `analyze_levels()` (signalstats
luma/saturation) for input and output side by side.

iPhone "HDR" video is Dolby Vision profile 8.4 on an HLG base layer:
`probe.py` reports `hdr_format: Dolby Vision profile 8` and `--to-sdr`
tone-maps it from the HLG base layer. When the user wants to keep HDR but
players mis-render the DV layer, `--strip-dovi` removes it losslessly.
`--to-sdr` does a real conversion: linearise (zscale, PQ or HLG), tone-map
(default `hable`, `mobius` keeps more highlight detail, `bt2390` is the
broadcast standard), then BT.709 gamma + matrix. Refuses when probe says the
input is not HDR unless `--force`. `--lut` applies a 3D .cube with
tetrahedral interpolation (Log→709 conversions, creative looks); blend with
`--lut-strength`. Everything else in the skill assumes SDR BT.709, so run this
first on HDR or Log sources.

### audio.py — clean-up, music, ducking, layout
```
audio.py INPUT [--voice | --denoise [--denoise-strength 25]] [--gain dB]
         [--music FILE [--music-volume -14] [--duck [--duck-amount 12]] [--music-loop]]
         [--fade-in S] [--fade-out S] [--stereo | --mono | --downmix] [--replace FILE] [-o OUT]
```
`--voice` = highpass 80 Hz → de-esser → FFT denoise → gentle compressor, the
standard talking-head chain. `--duck` uses a sidechain compressor keyed by the
speech so music dips under dialogue and swells in pauses. `--downmix` uses the
ITU centre/LFE weights for 5.1/7.1 → stereo. `--mono` averages a stereo pair,
leaves a 1-channel input untouched and downmixes >2 channels through
swresample. Video is always stream-copied.
Run `loudness.py` after this for final levels.

### loudness.py — EBU R128 normalisation
```
loudness.py INPUT [-I -14] [--tp -1] [--lra 11] [--measure-only] [-o OUT]
```
Two-pass `loudnorm`: measure, then apply with measured values (linear mode when
the true-peak ceiling allows). Video is stream-copied; audio becomes AAC in
video containers or the codec matching the extension (.wav → PCM, .flac, .mp3).
The written file is measured again: a lossy encoder can push peaks past the
ceiling loudnorm held (ffmpeg's AAC at 192k turned one transient from -2.4 to
+3.7 dBFS). When it does, the tool re-encodes -- first at 256k then 320k if you
did not pass `--audio-bitrate`, then with the loudnorm ceiling lowered by the
overshoot -- until the file itself meets `--tp`. `result` reports
`tp_ceiling_used`, `audio_bitrate_used`, `encodes`, and a `note` when the
integrated loudness ended more than 1 LU from the target because of it.

### export.py — delivery presets
```
export.py INPUT --preset youtube|youtube4k|reels|x|prores|h265|gif [--fit pad|crop] [--no-scale] [--allow-long] [--crf N] [-o OUT]
export.py --list
```
Scales into the preset frame (pad by default), tags BT.709, sets `+faststart`,
trims to platform maximums (Reels 90 s, X 140 s) unless `--allow-long`.

### proxy.py — low-bitrate proxy for analysis/preview
```
proxy.py INPUT [--width W | --scale F] [--crf N] [--fps N] [--no-audio] [-o OUT]
```
Not a delivery preset: resizes to `--width` (default 640) or by `--scale`
factor, re-encodes at a proxy-grade `--crf` (default 30) with the fastest
x264/x265 preset, keeps the source's own dynamic range (HDR stays HDR;
run `color.py --to-sdr` first if SDR is wanted). Only executes the spec
given — does not decide which asset to proxy or what for.
