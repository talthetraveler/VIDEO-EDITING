# ffmpeg-skill execution contract

`ffmpeg-skill contract --json` (or `python3 scripts/_contract.py --json`) prints a
machine-readable description of this skill: which tools exist, what each one needs,
takes and writes, how its result is verified, and what an agent may assume about
dry-run, input preservation and repeatability. It is the interface a planning agent
consumes instead of reading `SKILL.md`, which stays written for a coding agent that
follows the workflow by hand.

The contract is derived from the code that runs, not maintained beside it:

- the tool list is every script in `scripts/` that does not start with `_`;
- every `input_schema` is generated from the script's own `argparse` parser at the
  moment the contract is printed, so a new flag appears in the contract with no other edit;
- the facts a parser cannot express (role, required ffmpeg components, verification
  policy, visual-check policy) live in one table in `scripts/_contract.py` and are
  checked against the scripts, the MCP server and the installer by `tests/test_contract.py`.

## Versions

| Field | Meaning | Changes when |
|---|---|---|
| `contract_version` | shape of this document (`1.0`) | a key is renamed, removed or changes meaning |
| `skill.version` | the npm / package.json version (`1.4.13`) | any release |

A release that adds a tool or a flag keeps `contract_version`; a breaking change to the
ToolSpec shape bumps it. Consumers pin on `contract_version` and read `skill.version`
for provenance. Consumers should also pin `ffmpeg-skill` itself by npm version or git
tag, not by tracking `main` — see README, "Development", "Releasing".

The prose tool count in this file, README, `SKILL.md` and `package.json`'s description is
not generated (it reads naturally in a sentence), so `tests/test_contract.py`'s
`test_docs_tool_count_matches_the_real_tool_list` checks all five against the real count
from `scripts/` on every CI run instead — a stale count fails a test rather than drifting
silently. (`SKILL.md` was added to that check after its "the 28 scripts" sat stale through
twelve tool additions while the other three files were correct.)

## Stability guarantee (1.x)

1.0.0 was published on 2026-09-11 (by accident: see CHANGELOG.md's 1.0.0 entry; the number
is kept rather than burned). From 1.0.3 on, the number is treated as the promise it implies.
For the whole of 1.x:

| Surface | Promise |
|---|---|
| Tool ids (`ffmpeg-skill/<name>`) and script names | never removed or renamed |
| CLI arguments (`argparse` dests, flags, positionals) | never removed, renamed, or made newly required; new optional arguments may be added |
| `--json` output keys, and the keys of `contract --json` / `doctor --json` | never removed or given a different type; new keys may be added |
| Exit codes (0 success, 1 failure, 2 unknown/undecidable in `doctor`) | unchanged |
| `contract_version` (`1.0`) | unchanged; a ToolSpec shape change is a major |
| MCP `tools/list` names and `inputSchema` property names | derived from the above, so covered by the same promise |
| Behaviour of a tool for the same input and arguments | may change only to fix a defect or to track an FFmpeg change, and every such change gets a CHANGELOG line |

Not covered: the exact wording of `--help` text, descriptions, stderr messages, and the
`details`/`notes` free-text fields of JSON output; the internals under `scripts/_*.py`;
the evals harness; the development skills under `.claude/`.

The promise is enforced, not remembered: `tests/test_contract.py`'s
`test_mcp_tool_surface_matches_the_frozen_1x_snapshot` pins every tool's argument names and
which are required against `tests/fixtures/mcp_tools.json`. A removal, rename or newly
required argument fails CI; an addition fails until the snapshot is regenerated
(`UPDATE_MCP_SNAPSHOT=1 python3 tests/test_contract.py`), so the diff of the fixture shows a
reviewer exactly what grew.

## Deprecation policy

Something that has to go (an argument superseded by a better one, an output key that turned
out to be misleading) is retired in three steps, never in one:

1. **Deprecate** in a minor release: the old form keeps working unchanged, a one-line warning
   naming the replacement is printed to stderr when it is used, the CHANGELOG entry says
   "deprecated", and `--help` marks it `(deprecated: use ...)`.
2. **Keep** it for at least two further minor releases or 90 days, whichever is longer.
3. **Remove** it only in the next major (2.0.0), listed in that release's CHANGELOG under
   "Removed", together with the version that first deprecated it.

A defect fix that changes behaviour is not a deprecation: it ships in a patch with a
CHANGELOG line, and if the old behaviour was something a caller could reasonably have relied
on, the line says so.

## Skill

```json
{
  "contract_version": "1.0",
  "skill": {"id": "ffmpeg-skill", "version": "1.4.13", "execution_mode": "local", "kind": "execution",
            "entrypoints": {"cli": "...", "mcp": "...", "contract": "...", "doctor": "..."},
            "not_provided": ["AI reasoning", "decisions", "production plans", "project IR", "approvals", "network access", "transcription engine"]},
  "requirements": {"python": ">=3.9 (standard library only)", "ffmpeg": ">=5.0", "ffprobe": ">=5.0"},
  "execution": {"shell": false, "arbitrary_executables": false, "network": false, "input_mutation": false}
}
```

ffmpeg-skill is an execution skill. It measures, transforms and verifies media with
local FFmpeg. It does not reason, plan, decide, or hold a project model; those belong
to the agent that calls it.

## ToolSpec

One entry per tool under `tools`, sorted by id. Tool ids are stable:
`ffmpeg-skill/<script name>` (`ffmpeg-skill/cut`, `ffmpeg-skill/loudness`, …).

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id`, `name`, `version`, `executable` | `ffmpeg-skill/cut`, `cut`, skill version, `scripts/cut.py` |
| `role` | `analysis`, `analysis_and_execution`, `execution` or `verification` (see below) |
| `capabilities.required` | ffmpeg components the tool always needs |
| `capabilities.optional[]` | `{capability, when}`: needed only for that flag or input |
| `inputs`, `outputs` | asset kinds consumed and artifact kinds produced, in words |
| `input_schema` | generated from argparse: `properties` keyed by dest with `type`, `cli`, `enum`, `default`, `description`; `required`; `positional` (order); `mutually_exclusive` |
| `output_schema` | what `--json` prints on stdout |
| `supports_dry_run`, `dry_run` | whether `--dry-run` plans without running ffmpeg or writing files |
| `supports_json` | whether `--json` exists |
| `mutates_input` | always `false`: no tool overwrites its input |
| `produces_artifact` | writes a file (media, PNG, HTML, EDL) |
| `verification` | `{required, tools}`: which tools to run on the output afterwards |
| `requires_visual_verification` | the picture changed; run `ffmpeg-skill/look` and inspect the PNG |
| `reencodes_video`, `reencodes_audio` | `"always"` / `"never"` / `"conditional"`, meaning *when that stream is present in the input* — not whether the tool touches the file at all. `"conditional"` tools (`cut`, `export`, `render`, `batch`, `verify`, `caption`, `color`) carry a `reencode_note` explaining what it depends on — for `caption`, `--mode burn` (default) always re-encodes both streams, `--mode mux` copies both untouched; for `color`, `--strip-dovi` and `--retag` are a stream copy of both (retag only re-encodes if the copy attempt fails), while `--to-sdr` / `--lut` / `--correct` always re-encode both. Several visual tools (`fit`, `overlay`, `graphics`, `join`, `multicam`, `silence`) are `"always"` on audio too: this codebase never mixes `-c:v` re-encode with `-c:a copy` in one call, so a caller cannot assume the original audio codec survives just because only the picture changed |
| `audio_only` | accepts an audio-only input (WAV, MP3, M4A, FLAC, OGG, Opus) |
| `video_required` | refuses an input without a video stream ("input has no video stream") |
| | `join` has `audio_only: true` and `video_required: false` since 0.9.1: audio-only inputs are joined as audio (no `look` needed then); mixing audio and video inputs is refused |
| `deterministic_inputs`, `idempotency_hint` | see Repeatability |
| `mcp` | the MCP tool name and its positional arguments |

### Roles

| Role | Tools |
|---|---|
| `analysis` (measures, writes no media) | probe, scenes |
| `analysis_and_execution` (measures by default or with a flag, can also write) | silence (`--list`), loudness (`--measure-only`), sync (offset JSON without `-o`) |
| `execution` (writes a new artifact) | cut, fit, caption, overlay, graphics, multicam, audio, join, color, export, render, batch |
| `verification` (checks or shows an artifact) | check, look, verify, report |

### Verification policy

The workflow in `SKILL.md` is "probe first, verify last". The contract states it per tool:

| Tool | After it wrote an artifact, run |
|---|---|
| cut, silence, audio, sync, batch | probe |
| loudness | probe, check |
| export | probe, check |
| fit, caption, overlay, graphics, color, join, multicam | probe, look |
| render | probe, check, look |
| probe, check, look, scenes, verify, report | nothing (they are the verification) |

`requires_visual_verification` is `true` exactly for the tools that change the picture
(fit, caption, overlay, graphics, color, join, multicam, render). Audio-only tools and
audio-only inputs never need `look`; the report line is `Look: not needed`. `check`
rows carry `kind: format` (fix it) or `kind: judgement` (decide with the user).

### Dry run

`supports_dry_run` is measured, not declared: `tests/test_contract.py` runs every tool
with `--dry-run` behind a fake `ffmpeg` that records any call, and asserts that no
call happened and no file appeared. Under `--dry-run` a tool prints the command lines
it would run, reports `dry_run: true`, and never reports an output probe. The
exceptions are stated per tool in the contract's `dry_run` field: `probe` and `check` are
read-only (ffprobe still runs); `sync`, `multicam`, `scenes`, `cropdetect`, `report`, `silence`,
`loudness` and `stabilize` still run their ffmpeg/ffprobe measurements (the analysis is the
tool's job; only the artifact is skipped, including side files such as `--edl`, `--sheet` or a
generated `.ass`), and `verify` does not support dry-run (its steps run). `SKILL.md` and
`references/scripts.md` repeat the same list; the contract is the authority.

### Repeatability

No tool keeps state or uses randomness. `deterministic_inputs` is `false` only for
`verify`, whose output includes timings. `idempotency_hint` says what "same inputs"
gives you:

| Hint | Tools |
|---|---|
| `bit_exact` | probe, check, scenes, look |
| `content_equivalent` (same media, bytes may differ between encoder builds) | every encoding tool, cut, sync, report |
| `cached` | batch (content-hash cache, re-runs skip unchanged inputs) |
| `environment_dependent` | verify |

## `provides`

`provides` lists these 42 tools by a cross-repository Capability id, for
`kajisho5/AI-video-production-OS`'s `CapabilityContract.provides`
(`docs/SPEC.md` there), matching the ids already assigned to this Skill in
that project's own `docs/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md` section 9 ("ffmpeg-skill's
21 raw tools ... are Capabilities in their own right, independent of the
higher-level Skills that delegate to them"): `[{"id": "ffmpeg-skill.<tool>",
"lifecycle": "EXPERIMENTAL", "tool_id": "ffmpeg-skill/<tool>"}, ...]`, one
entry per tool, sorted by id. The Capability id uses a dot
(`ffmpeg-skill.cut`) - the `<domain>.<verb>` shape every other Skill's
Capability ids use elsewhere in that project (`video.trim`, `audio.gain`,
...), with `ffmpeg-skill` as the domain - while `tool_id` carries this
contract's own slash-shaped `id` (`ffmpeg-skill/cut`) unchanged. It is
purely additive: derived from `public_tools()`, saying nothing `tools[]`
doesn't already say, only indexed by Capability id instead of tool name.

## `capability_map`

`provides` re-indexes each tool by an id shaped like the tool name
(`ffmpeg-skill.cut`); it doesn't tell a caller that "I need to trim a
video" resolves to `cut`. `capability_map` is the small, hand-authored
table that closes that gap: `[{"capability": "<domain>.<verb>", "tool_id":
"ffmpeg-skill/<tool>", "params": {...}}, ...]`. A planner that only knows
an abstract goal (`video.trim`, `audio.loudness`, `subtitle.burn`,
`media.stream.inspect`, `media.frames.extract`, `media.proxy`) looks it up here to find
the tool, then builds and runs that tool's own call from its
`input_schema` exactly as it would have if it already knew the tool name -
`capability_map` never executes anything itself, and this skill never
picks a capability on the caller's behalf.

Some entries also fix one or more `params` where the capability names a
*specific* behaviour narrower than the whole tool: `video.reframe` maps
to `fit` with `params: {"fit": "crop"}`, because `fit.py` also does
duration-fit and letterbox padding, and only the crop mode is a
"reframe". A caller resolving `video.reframe` should treat those params
as fixed inputs to that tool's own schema, not as optional defaults.

This list is deliberately short and will stay short: a capability is only
added when resolving it is a mechanical, no-judgment lookup. There is no
`video.highlight` entry, for instance, because `scenes.py --highlights`
ranks candidates by a measured proxy (audio energy or duration), never by
understood content - offering it as a blindly-delegable capability would
misrepresent what it does (see SKILL.md, "What this skill does and does
not decide"). `media.proxy` (a low-bitrate, fast-decode proxy for
downstream analysis/preview, distinct from `export.py`'s delivery
presets) resolves to `proxy` - itself a mechanical resize + re-encode
with no opinion on which asset should be proxied or what for.

## Capabilities

Names: `ffmpeg`, `ffprobe`, `encoder:<name>`, `filter:<name>`, `bsf:<name>`,
`external:whisper`. `capabilities.required` is the union of every tool's required list;
`optional` the union of the conditional ones. With detection (the default)
`available`, `missing` and `missing_optional` are added from `doctor`, which reads
`ffmpeg -encoders / -filters / -bsfs` and looks for a local whisper. Pass `--static`
to omit detection. Nothing from the environment other than those lists and the
ffmpeg/ffprobe/python versions is printed; no environment variables, no paths.

`doctor` has three states per capability. `available` and `missing` come from a listing
that was read; `unknown` means the listing that would prove the capability could not be
read (`ffmpeg -filters` in a layout the parser does not recognise, or ffmpeg exiting
non-zero), and it is never folded into `missing`, so an installed filter is not reported
absent, nor into `available`, so a failed detection is not a pass. `detection` gives the
status (`parsed`, `unparsed`, `failed`, `missing`), row count and detail of each listing;
`errors` lists the unreadable ones. The filter parser recognises the FFmpeg 6/7 layout
(three flag characters, `..C acompressor A->A`) and the FFmpeg 8 layout (two, `T.
acompressor A->A`) by the io-spec token, so the flag width does not matter; fixtures for
both live in `tests/fixtures/`.

`ffmpeg-skill doctor` exits 0 when every required capability is available, 1 when one is
missing, 2 when none is missing but a required one is unknown. `ok` is true only for 0.
The keys of 0.9.0 (`available`, `missing`, `missing_optional`, `ok`) are unchanged.

`doctor`'s `tools` field folds that same per-capability `state` into a per-tool answer:
`{"<tool>": {"usable": "yes"|"no"|"unknown", "missing": [...], "fix": "...", "unknown": [...]}}`.
`missing`/`unknown` list only that tool's own required capabilities that are in that state
(`missing` is absent when there is none, same for `unknown`); `fix` is a one-line, plain-language
remedy for each missing capability, joined with "; " when there is more than one. This exists so
a caller does not have to cross-reference `available`/`missing` against each tool's own required
capabilities by hand to answer "can I run `caption.py` on this machine right now" -- `doctor`
passing overall does not mean every tool is usable (a plain Homebrew `ffmpeg` on macOS is `ok`
for tools that don't need `subtitles`/`drawtext`/`zscale`, but `caption.usable` is `"no"`).

`doctor`'s `gpu_encoders` field reports GPU-backed encoders (`nvenc`, `videotoolbox`, `qsv`,
`vaapi`, `amf`) present in this ffmpeg *build*, read from `-encoders` alone — `{"status":
"parsed"|"unparsed"|"failed"|"missing", "present": [...]}`. It proves the build shipped the
capability, not that the GPU/driver on this machine will accept a job (that needs a real
encode, which this introspection never runs). No tool declares or requires a GPU encoder, so
`gpu_encoders` never affects `ok` or any tool's `usable` — it exists purely so a caller can ask
the same honest yes/no/unknown question about GPU support that filter/encoder detection already
answers for everything else, without a tool here needing to use one.

`doctor`'s `fonts` field reports whether the default drawtext font (`caption.py`'s
`--animate`/`--karaoke`, `graphics.py`'s templates — `BRAND_DEFAULTS["font"]`, `"DejaVu Sans"`)
is actually installed — `{"default_font": "...", "status": "available"|"missing"|"unknown",
"detail": "..."}`. drawtext's `font=` is a fontconfig name lookup, and fontconfig silently
substitutes the closest match for *any* name, known or not — a missing font never fails the
encode, so drawtext's own exit code cannot detect it. `fc-match` is queried instead: `available`
when it resolves the name to itself, `missing` when it substitutes a different family, `unknown`
when `fc-match` itself is not on PATH or fails. Like `gpu_encoders`, this is purely informational
and never affects `ok` or any tool's `usable` — a substituted font is not a broken tool, just a
typeface the caller didn't ask for.

## Invocation

Structured arguments are the canonical way to call a tool, on the CLI or through MCP.
The mapping is stated in `invocation.structured.argument_mapping`: positionals in
`input_schema.positional` order, `key` → `--key` with `_` → `-`, booleans as bare flags,
arrays repeated, `output` → `-o`, `loudness.lufs` → `-I`. `--json` is appended for every
tool except `probe` (JSON by default) and `look`.

The MCP server also accepts `{"argv": [...]}` for CLI compatibility. That path is
marked `canonical: false`: it is still bound to the named script and never reaches a
shell, but an agent ecosystem should use the structured form. No tool, CLI or MCP,
runs a shell, evaluates strings, or executes anything other than the named script,
`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`.

## JSON output

Success (`exit 0`): one document matching `output_schema`, always with
`status: "completed"`, `output`, `dry_run`, `commands`, and `probe` of the output when a
file was written. `probe` prints its measurement document directly.

Success is decided by `verify_output` in `_common.py`, not by the ffmpeg exit code alone:
the file must exist, be non-empty and give ffprobe at least one stream. A tool that ran
ffmpeg successfully but has no usable artifact fails with `kind: output` (a 0-byte file is
removed so a later step cannot mistake it for a result).

Failure (non-zero exit; 127 when ffmpeg/ffprobe is missing): the message on stderr as
before, and, when `--json` was given, on stdout:

```json
{"status": "failed", "exit_code": 1,
 "error": {"kind": "input | ffmpeg | output | missing_tool | timeout | verification | interrupted", "message": "...",
           "code": "INPUT_INVALID | DEPENDENCY_MISSING | FFMPEG_EXECUTION_FAILED | OUTPUT_INVALID | TIMEOUT | VERIFICATION_FAILED | INTERNAL_ERROR",
           "retryable": false},
 "commands": ["ffmpeg ..."]}
```

`message` carries the script's own reason (missing input, ffprobe failure, the last
stderr lines of ffmpeg, the verification that failed); an optional `error.hint` names the
flag change that would make a retry meaningful (never a diagnosis of the media); `commands` lists what was planned
or run so the caller can retry or report without re-deriving the command. `code` is a
purely additive, statically-mapped relabelling of `kind` (never a new distinction `kind`
doesn't already make) for a caller that wants a stable enum instead of matching `kind`
strings. `retryable` is currently always `false`: none of the kinds are distinguishable
today from a deterministic failure that would fail identically on a blind retry, so nothing
here claims otherwise until real exit-code/stderr sniffing exists to back that up.

## MCP relationship

`mcp/server.py` is a transport. It holds no tool table and no schema of its own:

```
argparse parser  →  ToolSpec.input_schema  →  contract  →  MCP tools/list inputSchema
```

At start-up the server builds the ToolSpecs (`_contract.build(detect=False)`) and
derives each `tools/list` entry with `_contract.mcp_tool`: the name is the ToolSpec
name, the order is the contract's sorted order, and `inputSchema` is
`_contract.mcp_input_schema(ToolSpec)`. `tools/call` maps structured arguments to
argv with the ToolSpec's `mcp.positional` and `mcp.argument_exceptions`. A new
public script, a removed one, or a changed parser therefore changes the MCP surface
with no edit to `mcp/`; `tests/test_contract.py` proves this by copying the skill,
adding, removing and editing scripts, and reading `tools/list` again.

### Translation, and what JSON Schema cannot say

| ToolSpec.input_schema | MCP inputSchema |
|---|---|
| `properties.<dest>.type / enum / default / description / items` | copied as is |
| `properties.<dest>.cli`, `.common` | dropped (ffmpeg-skill-only keys) |
| `positional` | same properties, passed by name; description gets a `(positional N)` prefix |
| `required` | `required` of the structured branch |
| `mutually_exclusive` groups | `allOf: [{not: {required: [a, b]}} …]` for every pair |
| `one_of_required` groups | `anyOf: [{required: [a]}, …]` |
| raw `argv` compatibility | an `argv` array property; top-level `anyOf: [{required: [argv]}, <structured branch>]` |
| `additionalProperties: false` | kept |

Two things are documented rather than encoded, because JSON Schema has no way to
express them: when `argv` is present every other key is ignored (stated in the `argv`
description), and MCP has no notion of positional order, so positionals are named
properties whose order is only informative. `%(default)s` help interpolation is
already applied when the ToolSpec is built.

The `tools/list` document is deterministic (byte-identical across processes and
identical to the translation of `contract --json`), which the tests check.

## Consuming the contract from an agent

A planning agent (for example video-production-agent's SkillRegistry) can:

1. run `ffmpeg-skill contract --json` once and register the skill by `skill.id` and the
   tools by `id`;
2. resolve `capabilities.required` against `capabilities.available` before planning;
3. pick a tool by `role`, `inputs`/`outputs`, `video_required` and `audio_only`;
4. build the call from `input_schema` and the argument mapping, plan with `--dry-run`;
5. run, parse `output_schema`, then run `verification.tools`, adding `look` when
   `requires_visual_verification` is true.

The measurement documents (`probe`, `check`, `scenes`, `sync`) are ffmpeg-skill's own
shapes, not another system's Observation model; convert them in the agent's adapter.
ffmpeg-skill contains no agent-specific code.

## Where things live

- `scripts/_contract.py`: the generator (`--json`, `--static`, `doctor`)
- `bin/install.js`: `ffmpeg-skill contract` and `ffmpeg-skill doctor`
- `tests/test_contract.py`: schema, consistency (scripts = MCP = installer), MCP inputSchema derived from the contract (equality, determinism, drift, round trips), dry-run, JSON shapes, verification policy, real-media run
- `evals/contract/`: questions an agent must answer from the contract alone, with the expected answers checked against the live contract
- `tests/release_check.sh`: runs the contract from the packed and installed copies before a release
