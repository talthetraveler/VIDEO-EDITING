# codes for distinctions the code can't actually make would be guessing, not reporting -- if a
# future call site can genuinely tell capability-missing apart from bad-argument (see doctor()'s

    that uses explicit `[label]` pads -- confirmed by rendering the result: the text
    value doesn't end where the quote closes it, and trailing option names/values
    (fontfile=..., fontsize=...) leak into the rendered picture as literal text
    instead of being parsed as options. A quote is therefore dropped outright rather
    than escaped -- losing one apostrophe from a label is a fine trade for "the
    filter graph parses the way the code intends, on every call shape this codebase
    uses it in".

    `%` has the same problem the quote character did: `\%` is not a real escape as
    far as drawtext's own text-expansion scanner (on by default, `expansion=normal`,
    for `%{pts}`/`%{localtime}`/etc.) is concerned -- a bare backslash-escaped `%`
    always logs "Stray % near ..." (confirmed with the minimal case
    `text='100\%done'`), which is merely noisy on one ffmpeg
    build (the warning is printed, the file still gets written) but a hard filtering
    failure that writes no output at all on another. Every caller of this function
    only ever wants a literal label, never `%{...}` expansion, so `%` is dropped
    outright rather than chasing a per-build-safe escape (`expansion=none` on the
    filter would also fix it, but needs touching every drawtext= call site instead
    of the one shared helper). Control characters (newline, tab, ...) are dropped
    for the same reason: none are meaningful in a one-line burnt-in label, and
    unlike the graph-special characters above, ffmpeg's own text-expansion scanner
    -- not just the graph parser -- is involved in whether they're actually safe."""
