## Authentication

Every request to the API needs `Authorization: Bearer <api-key>`. The key is **never bundled in this skill** — it's resolved at runtime from one of two sources, depending on where the skill is running:

**Claude Code CLI (shell-backed):** read `$ZERNIO_API_KEY` from the environment.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
export ZERNIO_API_KEY="zk_xxx"

# Windows PowerShell
$env:ZERNIO_API_KEY = "zk_xxx"
```

**Claude.ai web (no shell):** ask the user to paste the key in chat at Step 1, hold it in working memory for the conversation, and use it in every API call. Never echo the key back, never write it to a file.

Get your key from https://zernio.com/dashboard/api-keys.

See `SKILL.md § Resolving the API key` for the full resolution flow including error messages and the universal "never persist to disk" rules.

## Account model

Every post needs an `accountId` per platform you're publishing to. Resolve them at runtime — no local config needed:

```bash
curl -s "https://zernio.com/api/v1/accounts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZERNIO_API_KEY"
```

Response shape (abbreviated):

```json
[
  { "id": "acc_abc", "platform": "youtube",   "username": "@handle" },
  { "id": "acc_def", "platform": "instagram", "username": "@handle" },
  { "id": "acc_ghi", "platform": "linkedin",  "username": "handle" }
]
```

Map `platform` → `id` for every platform named in your manifest. If a platform isn't in the response, it isn't connected — connect it in the Zernio dashboard first.

## Media upload flow

See `reference/zernio-upload.md` for the full flow: presign (video + thumbnail), PUT upload with `--tls-max 1.2`, HEAD verification, the CRC32 bug, and the mandatory external-storage fallback for files over 50 MB.

---

## Create post flow

See `reference/zernio-post.md` for the full POST body, field placement rules, the 10 critical mistakes to avoid, per-platform `platformSpecificData` shapes, scheduling rules, and YouTube-specific fields (category IDs, Shorts length routing).

---

## Per-platform capabilities

See `reference/platforms.md` for the full capability matrix (video / image / carousel / text-only, thumbnail support, first-comment support, scheduled publish, caption limits) and per-platform media specs (aspect ratios, max duration).

---

## Posting principles

See `reference/principles.md` for pre-post checklist, the approval gate, verification protocol, and anti-patterns (`publishNow: true` for multi-platform, copy-paste captions, skipping tag validation, etc.).

---

## CLI (optional, prefer raw API)

If the `zernio` CLI is installed:

```bash
zernio media:upload <file>
zernio posts:create --text "..." --accounts "id1,id2" --scheduledAt "ISO8601"
zernio posts:list
zernio posts:get <id>
zernio posts:delete <id>
zernio posts:retry <id>
zernio analytics:posts
zernio accounts:list
```

This skill defaults to the raw REST API — the CLI changes faster than the REST endpoints and has its own quirks. Use the CLI only if you specifically prefer it.

---

## Listing / querying posts

```bash
# Recent published posts
curl -s "https://zernio.com/api/v1/posts?status=published&limit=10" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZERNIO_API_KEY"

# Specific post by ID
curl -s "https://zernio.com/api/v1/posts/{postId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ZERNIO_API_KEY"
```

The skill uses `GET /posts/{postId}` at Step 6 to verify a post landed.

## Canonical spec

`reference/zernio-openapi.yaml` is the version-controlled OpenAPI spec (17K lines). It's the source of truth for every field name, type, and platform schema. The markdown files in this folder are friendly guides; when in doubt, grep the YAML.
